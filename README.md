# Working with Express

Description: This project allows users to open an Express.js-enabled HTTP server locally, access it from the website: http://localhost:3000, and, through the website, communicate to the server to execute a number of different operations. The server is set up using Node.js and Express.js frameworks, along with their associated dependencies. 

How to install and run the project: Download the root directory folder into any folder you desire, then open your terminal and cd to the root directory. Type the command "npm start", and the server should start running. To communicate with the server on the client side, open a web browser, go to http://localhost:3000, and visit the website.
